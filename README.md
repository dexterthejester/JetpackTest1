# JetpackTest1

First Jetpack Compose test project. Don't expect much.

## What's inside?

This is the default Jetpack Compose project. I modified the text on bootup to "Hello $name, welcome back!". *Don't ask me why.*  
This also serves as a test Git repo, because i **need** to learn Git, lest I suffer later on.

## New branch
  
This was added into a branch.
I really do not get markdown newline. Why do I need double spaces to indicate a newline?  
To be honest, I think this is rather unintuitive and clunky.
How will you be able to see the newlines???
