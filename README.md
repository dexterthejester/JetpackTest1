# JetpackTest1

First Jetpack Compose test project. Don't expect much.

## What's inside?

This is the default Jetpack Compose project. I modified the text on bootup to "Hello $name, welcome back!". *Don't ask me why.*
This also serves as a test Git repo, because i **need** to learn Git, lest I suffer later on.
