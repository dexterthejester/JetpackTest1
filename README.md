# JetpackTest1

First Jetpack Compose test project. Don't expect much.

## What's inside?

This is the default Jetpack Compose project. 
At first, I only modified the text on bootup to "Hello $name, welcome back!".
Afterwards, I added more and more Text() lines both because I was frustrated, and because I wanted to debug why the commits were under my main account instead of my alt.
This also serves as a test Git repo, because i **need** to learn Git, lest I suffer later on.

## Previous, deleted branch
  
This was added into a branch.
I really do not get markdown newline. Why do I need double spaces to indicate a newline?  
To be honest, I think this is rather unintuitive and clunky.
How will you be able to see the newlines???
It's so hard to understand...

## New branch: change_md

This was added into another branch. 
I changed stuff!  
Wow!  
I still find newlines clunky...
